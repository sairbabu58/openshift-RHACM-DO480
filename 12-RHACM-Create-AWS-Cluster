# Create OpenShift Cluster on AWS

# Process for create OpenShif cluster on AWS
  1) Create a Credentials for AWS with below details
      > Add Credentials
      > Choose AWS
      > Credential type : Amazon Web Services
      > Credential name: aws-credential
      > namespace: aws-cluster (Create NS)
      > Base DNS domain : example.com (FQDN: ocp4.example.com)
      > Access key ID: <key-details>
      > Secret access key: <access-key-details>
      > Pull secret: (get it from console.redhat.com/openshift)
      > SSH private key: 
      > SSH public key
      > Save

  2) Create AWS cluster
      > Infrastructure -> Cluster -> Create cluster
      > Infrastructure Provider
      > AWS
      > Infrastructure provider credential: aws-credential
      > Cluster name: ocp4
      > Cluster set: {}
      > Base DNS domain: autofill
      > Release image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.10.57-x86_64 (cluster version)
      > Additional labels: name=prod, env=prodduction
      > (NoodPool configure)
      > Region: choose
      > Control plane pool
         Zones:
         Instance type:
         Root storage (GiB):
      > Worker pool 1
         Pool name: small-worker
         Zones :
         Instance type:
         Node count:
         Root storage (GiB):
      > Worker pool 2
         Pool name: big-worker
         Zones :
         Instance type:
         Node count:

      > Cluster network CIDR: 
      > Network host prefix:

# Additional Features
  1) Hibernate Cluster: Not all OpenShift clusters need to run continuously. For example, development clusters are probably not used during the night. 
     Therefore, it makes sense to hibernate these clusters during off hours to save on cloud hosting costs.
   >  Infrastructure → Clusters
   > Choose your cluster
   > (...) Hibernate
   > (...) Resume
   
   
   
# AWS OpenShift cluster secret details.
  > oc project ocp4
  > oc get secret| grep ocp4
  > oc extract secret/<name> --to=-
  
  
  
# Upgrade cluster
  > Choose the cluster 
  > (...) click upgrade
  

# Scale UP/Down nodes
  > Choose the cluster
  > Machine pools 
  > Choose your Machine pools 
  > (...) Scale machine pool
  > Machine set replica count : 3 UP/Down
  > Scale
  
  
# Work with Cluster Autoscaler
  > Infrastructure → Clusters.
  > Select your sno-GUID managed cluster.
  > Switch to the Machine pools tab, click (...) and select Enable autoscale.
  > Minimum replicas: 0 
  > Maximum replicas: 3
  > Scale
  
  Validation:
  > oc get clusterautoscaler 
  > oc get machineautoscaler -n openshift-machine-api
  > oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api
  > oc get nodes
