Chapter-01:

# Hub cluster (Main cluster where you can manager other k8s or openshift cluster)
# Manage cluster (other k8s or openshift cluster managed by Hub cluster)

# Once ACM istallation is done, it will create some namespaces on Hub Cluster
  > open-cluster-management                 (content main features like; ACM web-console, application search engine, deploy & manage lifecycle of cluster)
  > open-cluster-management-hub             (content the deployments that receive data from the managed clusters)
  > open-cluster-management-observability   (content all the thanos deployment that store, create & visualize the observability. the namespace on present if you enable the RHACM obeservability engine)
  
# Once Managed cluster is added to Hub cluster, it will create some namespaces on Managed cluster
Agent lists:
  > theklusterletagent
  > thesearchengineadd-on
  > the add-on for managing application deployments from RHACM
  > the add-on for applying policies
  > theadd-onfortheobservabilitycomponents

Namespace lists:
  > open-cluster-management-agent                       (contains the deployments for the klusterlet agent)
  > open-cluster-management-agent-addon                 (contains the application's deployments,s earch engine, and policies engines)
  > open-cluster-management-agent-addon-observability   (contains the observability engine's deployments)





Chapter-02:

1) Search bar
2) Access Controlr for RHACM
3) Role-based Access Control
4) Identity Management 

Infrastructure Tab:
------------------

  > Creating or upgrading a cluster in many different public cloud providers. Importing an existing cluster to the RHACM hub cluster so that you can manage it.
  > Manually scaling the clusters, or enabling autoscaling. The process of resizing a cluster is different if you created the cluster by using RHACM, or if the cluster already existed and you imported it to RHACM.
  > Using RHACM features such as cluster sets, cluster pools, and discovering clusters.
  
RBAC:
-----

open-cluster-management: cluster-manager-admin ==> RHACM super user, with full access. Can create a ManagedCluster resource.

open-cluster-management: admin:managed_cluster_name ==> RHACM administrator access to the ManagedCluster resource named managed_cluster_name.

open-cluster-management: view:managed_cluster_name ==> RHACM view access to the ManagedCluster resource named managed_cluster_name.

open-cluster-management: managedclusterset:admin: managed_clusterset_name ==> RHACM administrator access to the ManagedClusterSet resource named managed_clusterset_name.

open-cluster-management: managedclusterset:view: managed_clusterset_name ==> RHACM view access to the ManagedClusterSet resource named managed_clusterset_name.

open-cluster-management: subscription-admin ==> Can create Git subscriptions that deploy Kubernetes resources YAML files to multiple namespaces.


RHACM also supports the following default RHOCP roles:
-----------------------------------------------------
cluster-admin
admin
edit
view

Pratical:
--------
1) Search bar
2) Cluster sets (prod, stage)
3) Assign RBAC/role to group, who can manage which cluster (prod, stage)
4) IDM configuration, User, groups (optional not covering this chapter)
